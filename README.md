# Modern City - Vector Animation

Illustrated landing page with animated elements. 

I used Figma and Affinity Designer to craft the illustrations, and GSAP for the coded animations. 

The animation is currently enabled only on Desktop, while a static background image is served as a replacement on smaller screens.

Here's the link to the [demo](https://gifted-jang-6fed2c.netlify.app/).
